    <h2>Feature</h2>
    <p><b>LIOS ECOSYSTEM</b>
    We will build a blockchain and cryptocurrency- based LIOS platform via a Token Generation Event (TGE). 
    LIOS platform will create and maintain LIOS ecosystem, which allows free participation and convenient sharing, 
    thereby contributing to the dissolution of information inequality and the common development of humankind.</p>    
    <p><b>LIOS PLATFORM</b>
    We will construct large infrastructure that enable OpenNMT and LIOS Marketplace after TGE.
    With more than 100 million platform members, who provide their collective intelligence, we will develop OpenNMT. 
    LIOS will contribute to world peace and prosperity by establishing a new model of open source development and enabling free communication of humanity.</p>
	 <p><b>Blockchain based Marketplace</b>
    Based on Human Translation and Machine Translation market place, we will create the participant-centric platform that evolve into an ecosystem of artificial intelligence. 
    LIOS platform applies a blockchain system that enables copyright, translation, and transaction information to work efficiently. 
    Compensation for participation and copyright management of contents and systems will be made by LIOS coin(LIO). 
    LIOS’ blockchain provides a model that reasonably evaluate and compensate for the various contributions to develop artificial intelligence technologies 
    uch as software, libraries, algorithms, languages, and metadata.</p>

	
    <p><b>Open NMT based SYSTRAN SaaS</b>
    We will activate OpenNMT, an open source-based development community, through this LIOS TGE. 
    LIOS platform will allow more people to join the community and make the soil of OpenNMT more fertile. 
    LIOS wants to become a global platform that produces rich contents to help everyone who needs communication, including translation experts and developers.</p>
    
    <p><b>HYPER-TRANSLATION</b>
    Transaction models within LIOS Platform are various. 
    There will be data transactions for translations and translation engines, 
    application transactions that followed the technical improvement of the translation engine, 
    and service transactions that these two models are combined in various ways.
    Blockchain-based pricing functions and value distribution functions within LIOS Platform system will implement actual models.
    Hyper-Translation is the integrated concepts for realization of all these transactions.
    It not only indicates all of the allocation of reward from the contribution of confirmation, guaranteed copyrights, 
    content creation and distribution in the blockchain database, also includes a reproduction of value and process of exchange in the market of subsystem which is built into ecosystem.
    It can be categorized largely as “creation and assignment of copyrights in copyrighted materials
    / distribution of copyrighted materials / purchase of copyrighted materials / development and registration of applications / purchase of applications / development and registration of services / use of services / payment of platform fees.
    Each type occurs actual value exchange with overlay and repetition, 
    and it is the Hyper Translation which is designed as a translation processing for all of these processes between people,
     people to system, or system to system LIOS coin(LIO) operates as a default medium in Hyper-Translation process.</p>
